# Birthday-calculator
This is a basic Java birthday calculator that calculates your age, and tells you the day of the week that you were born on your birth year. It also tells you the day of the week it falls in the present year and displays how many days you have left until your next birthday. I used a Java calendar library to get the historical data for the dates. 
The Java file for this project is found in this repo, and a screen recorder for the application is found below.
